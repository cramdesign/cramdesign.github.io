		<p class="intro">Typography is the art and technique of arranging type in order to make language visible. The arrangement of type involves the selection of typefaces, point size, line length, leading (line spacing), adjusting the spaces between groups of letters (tracking) and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). Type design is a closely related craft, which some consider distinct and others a part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. In modern times, typography has been put into motion?in film, television and online broadcasts?to add emotion to mass communication.</p>
	
		<p>Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic designers, art directors, comic book artists, graffiti artists, clerical workers, and anyone else who arranges type for a product. Until the Digital Age, typography was a specialized occupation. Digitization opened up typography to new generations of visual designers and lay users, and David Jury states that &#8220;typography is now something everybody does.&#8221;</p>
	
		<h1>Top Level Header</h1>
	
		<p>Above is an example of a top level header element, or the <code>h1</code> tag. All page titles have been set in this tag. Consider using the Second Level Header tag, <code>h2</code>, for any important page level headings.</p>
	
		<h2>Second Level Header</h2>
	
		<p>As mentioned above, the Second Level Header is best used for important page level headings. Though there is no hard and fast rule regarding the amount of <code>h1</code> tags allowed on a page, I tend to always only use one and rely on <code>h2</code> for critical page headings.</p>
	
		<h3>Third Level Header</h3>
	
		<p>The Third Level Header may be used for any form of page level headings which falls below the<code>h2</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
	
		<h4>Fourth Level Header</h4>
	
		<p>The Fourth Level Header may be used for any form of page level headings which falls below the <code>h3</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
	
		<h5>Fifth Level Header</h5>
	
		<p>The Fifth Level Header may be used for any form of page level headings which falls below the<code>h4</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
	
		<h6>Sixth Level Header</h6>
	
		<p>The Sixth Level Header may be used for any form of page level headings which falls below the<code>h5</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
	
		<h2>Commonly Used Typography Tags</h2>
	
		<h3>Paragraph</h3>
	
		<p>All paragraphs are wrapped with the <code>p</code> tag. This tag can also be wrapped by the<code>blockquote</code> tag if the text is a quote for an external source or a pull quote from an article.</p>
	
		<h3>Block Quotes</h3>
	
		<p>Block quotes are section of content quoted from an external source or quotes pulled from the article itself. The <code>blockquote</code> may contain a <code>p</code> tag. For example, we are quoting Paul Rand, from <a href="http://quotesondesign.com/ray-eames/" title="Ray Eames quote source">Quotes on Design</a>, below.</p>
	
		<blockquote>
			<div>
				<p>Any system that sees aesthetics as irrelevant, that separates the artist from the product, that fragments the work of the individual, or creates by committee, or makes mincemeat of the creative process will in the long run diminish not only the product but the maker as well.</p>
			</div>
		</blockquote>
	
		<h3>Inline Quotes</h3>
	
		<p>The <code>q</code> tag is used for short quotations inline within a paragraph. Here is an example of nested quotations.</p>
	
		<p>He said, <q>The official Buzz Lightyear catch phrase is, <q>To infinity and beyond!</q></q></p>
	
		<h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
	
		<p>Ordered lists, or <code>ol</code> are used to list items in an hierarchical fashion. Each list item, or <code>li</code>, is preceded by a numerical representation of its place in the hierarchy. An ordered list can also contain another ordered list as well as an unordered list, or <code>ul</code>.</p>
	
		<ol>
			<li>This is the first item in an ordered list.</li>
	
			<li>This is the second item in an ordered list with a sub-ordered list.
				<ol>
					<li>This is an ordered list item.</li>
					<li>This is an ordered list item</li>
					<li>This is an ordered list item</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
	
			<li>This is the third item in an ordered list.</li>
	
			<li>This is the fourth item in an ordered list with a sub-unordered list.
				<ul>
					<li>This is an unordered list item</li>
					<li>This is an unordered list item</li>
					<li>This is an unordered list item</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
		</ol>
	
		<h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
	
		<p>Unordered lists, or <code>ul</code> are used to list items without any hierarchical value to them. Each list item may be preceded by a bullet or any non numerical representation. An unordered list can also contain an ordered list as well as another unordered list.</p>
	
		<ul>
			<li>This is the first item in an unordered list.</li>
	
			<li>This is the second item in an unordered list with a sub-ordered list.
				<ol>
					<li>This is an ordered list item.</li>
					<li>This is an ordered list item</li>
					<li>This is an ordered list item</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
	
			<li>This is the third item in an unordered list.</li>
	
			<li>This is the fourth item in an unordered list with a sub-unordered list.
				<ul>
					<li>This is an unordered list item</li>
					<li>This is an unordered list item</li>
					<li>This is an unordered list item</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	
		<h3>Definition Lists</h3>
	
		<p>Definition lists, or <code>dl</code> are generally used to denote a list of items that share a relationship with one another. A <code>dl</code> should contain at least one <code>dt</code> and one <code>dd</code>.</p>
	
		<dl>
			<dt>di·vis·i·ble [dih-viz-uh-buhl]</dt>
			<dd>capable of being evenly divided, without remainder.</dd>
		</dl>
	
		<h3>Links</h3>
	
		<p>Links are commonly used to link one page to another, either <a href="http://www.vrcfa.com/" title="Home">internally</a> or <a href="http://www.shawnee.edu/">externally</a> and are wrapped by the <code>a</code> tag.</p>
	
		<h3>Emphasized Text</h3>
	
		<p>Emphasized text is usually relegated to text you would pronounce differently in a conversation or text you are putting a stressed emphasis on and is wrapped inside of the <code>em</code> tag. For example:</p>
	
		<p>Reading <em>this blog</em> will make you a better person.</p>
	
		<h3>Strong Text</h3>
	
		<p>Strong text is usually relegated to text you are placing strong emphasis on and is wrapped inside of the <code>strong</code> tag. For example:</p>
	
		<p>Subscribe to this blog's RSS Feed <strong>now</strong> or you will be sorry.</p>
	
		<h3>Marked or highlighted text</h3>
	
		<p>The <code>mark</code> tag is used for indicating text as marked or highlighted for reference purposes, due to its relevance in another context. The <code>mark</code> tag was introduced in HTML 5. Internet Explorer 8 and older do not support this tag. For example:</p>
	
		<p>Despite the stock market crash in 2008, the value of my share portfolio <mark>increased by 100 percent</mark>. I must be doing something right.</p>
	
		<h3>Small Print</h3>
	
		<p>The <code>small</code> element is used to represent disclaimers, caveats, legal restrictions, or copyrights (commonly referred to as <em>small print</em>). It can also be used for attributions or satisfying licensing requirements. For example:</p>
	
		<p><small>Copyright © 2012 Business Name. All Rights Reserved.</small></p>
	
		<h3>Delete &amp; Insert</h3>
	
		<p>Markup of deleted text can be useful in determining differences between multiple versions of the same document. Browsers will normally strike a line through deleted text and underline inserted text. For example:</p>
	
		<p>Business Name is located in <del datetime="2014-08-30T15:50:45+00:00">West Hollywood, CA</del> <ins datetime="2014-08-30T15:50:45+00:00">Portsmouth, OH</ins>.</p>
	
		<h3>Citation</h3>
	
		<p>The <code>cite</code> element is used to represent the title of a work (e.g. a book, essay, poem, song, film, TV show, sculpture, painting, musical, exhibition, etc). This can be a work that is being quoted or referenced in detail (i.e. a citation), or it can just be a work that is mentioned in passing. For example:</p>
	
		<p>I highly recommend reading <cite>The Fountainhead</cite> by Ayn Rand. It changed my life when I was 18 years old.</p>
	
		<h3>Abbreviations &amp; Acronyms</h3>
	
		<p>The <code>abbr</code> element is used for any abbreviated text, whether it be acronym, initialism, or otherwise. Any text in the title attribute will appear when the user?s mouse hovers the abbreviation. The <code>acronym</code> tag has been dropped from the HTML 5 specs because of the confusion between these two tags. You should exclusively use <code>abbr</code> but both are styled for this theme. For example:</p>
	
		<p>The abbreviation for the National Football League is <abbr title="National Football League">NFL</abbr> and the acronym for as "soon as possible" is <acronym title="as soon as possible">ASAP</acronym>.</p>
	
		<h3>Subscript &amp; Superscript</h3>
	
		<p>The <code>sub</code> tag defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the baseline. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
	
		<p>The <code>sup</code> tag defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the baseline. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like this example<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>
	
		<h3>Code &amp; Code Blocks</h3>
	
		<p>The <code>code</code> tag is useful for websites who intend to share computer code snippets. When wrapped by the <code>pre</code> tag, a larger block of code can be displayed.</p>
	
		<pre>
		<code>
		@media only screen and ( min-width: 42em ) and ( max-width: 50em ) {
			 article {
				  width: 70%;
			 }
			 aside {
				  width: 30%;
			 }
		}
		</code>
		</pre>
	
		<fieldset>
			<legend>Fieldset with legend</legend>
			<label>First Name<input type="text"></label><br>
			<label>Last Name<input type="text"></label><br>
			<label>Your Message<textarea></textarea></label><br>
			<input type="submit" value="Submit">
		</fieldset>
	
		<h2>Tabular Data</h2>
	
		<p>The <code>table</code> tag is best used for presenting tabular data. This tag should always contain the<code>thead</code>, <code>tfoot</code> and <code>tbody</code> tags and should be marked up in that order. The <code>table</code> tag can also contain the <code>caption</code> tag for accessibility.</p>
