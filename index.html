	<p class="intro">Typography is the art and technique of arranging type in order to make language visible. The arrangement of type involves the selection of typefaces, point size, line length, leading (line spacing), adjusting the spaces between groups of letters (tracking) and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). Type design is a closely related craft, which some consider distinct and others a part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. In modern times, typography has been put into motion?in film, television and online broadcasts?to add emotion to mass communication.</p>
	<p>Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic designers, art directors, comic book artists, graffiti artists, clerical workers, and anyone else who arranges type for a product. Until the Digital Age, typography was a specialized occupation. Digitization opened up typography to new generations of visual designers and lay users, and David Jury states that &#8220;typography is now something everybody does.&#8221;</p>
	<h1>Top Level Header</h1>
	<p>Above is an example of a top level header element, or the <code>h1</code> tag. All page titles have been set in this tag. Consider using the Second Level Header tag, <code>h2</code>, for any important page level headings.</p>
	<h2>Second Level Header</h2>
	<p>As mentioned above, the Second Level Header is best used for important page level headings. Though there is no hard and fast rule regarding the amount of <code>h1</code> tags allowed on a page, I tend to always only use one and rely on <code>h2</code> for critical page headings.</p>
	<h3>Third Level Header</h3>
	<p>The Third Level Header may be used for any form of page level headings which falls below the <code>h2</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
	<h4>Fourth Level Header</h4>
	<p>The Fourth Level Header may be used for any form of page level headings which falls below the <code>h3</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
	<h5>Fifth Level Header</h5>
	<p>The Fifth Level Header may be used for any form of page level headings which falls below the <code>h4</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
	<h6>Sixth Level Header</h6>
	<p>The Sixth Level Header may be used for any form of page level headings which falls below the <code>h5</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
	<h3>Paragraph</h3>
	<p>All paragraphs are wrapped with the <code>p</code> tag. This tag can also be wrapped by the <code>blockquote</code> tag if the text is a quote for an external source or a pull quote from an article.</p>
